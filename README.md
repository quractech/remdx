# remdx
The REMDx (Realtime Efficiency Measurement Unit x) is used for datalogging.
Originally the device was make for measuring effeciency hence the name REMDx, but later evolved to a datalogging device.
The REMDx is capable of measuring:
- 2 channel votlage measurement 0-35V with resolution of approximately 1mV
- 2 channel current measurement 0-8A  with resolution of approximately 250uA
- 2 channel power measurent
- 2 channel burden voltage measurent
